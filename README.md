Introduction
This project demonstrates how to classify images of cats and dogs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The CNN model is trained on a dataset of labeled images and can predict whether a given image contains a cat or a dog.

Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following dependencies:

Python 3.7+
TensorFlow 2.x
Keras
NumPy
Matplotlib
OpenCV
Jupyter Notebook (optional, for interactive use)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cat-dog-classification.git
cd cat-dog-classification
Create a virtual environment and activate it:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset
Download the Cats and Dogs dataset from Kaggle and extract it into a folder named data inside the project directory.

The directory structure should look like this:

lua
Copy code

Usage
Preprocess the data:

bash
Copy code
python src/data_preprocessing.py
Train the model:

bash
Copy code
python src/train.py
Evaluate the model:

bash
Copy code
python src/evaluate.py
Model Training
The train.py script is used to train the CNN model. It includes:

Loading and preprocessing the dataset.
Defining the CNN architecture.
Compiling the model with appropriate loss function and optimizer.
Training the model on the dataset.
Saving the trained model to the models/ directory.
Evaluation
The evaluate.py script is used to evaluate the performance of the trained model. It includes:

Loading the trained model from the models/ directory.
Evaluating the model on the test dataset.
Printing and visualizing the evaluation metrics.
Results
After training and evaluating the model, the results including accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix will be displayed. You can also visualize the model's performance using graphs and sample predictions.
